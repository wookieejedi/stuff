 XSTR("$f Paradigm $f Shift

Last week's incident at the Bilbringi shipyards has triggered a wave of patriotic fervor throughout the Empire and shaken the confidence of many of our backers.  Although the fallout from this incident has weakened us, it may also provide an opportunity to strike a meaningful symbolic blow against the Emperor's war machine.  

Our fleet's raids on Imperial shipping have been a thorn in the side of the regional governors, but they have done little to legitimize the war effort or separate us from the type of radicals accused of causing the Bilbringi catastrophe.  Our next series of operations aims to change that.", -1)

$Stage Text:
 XSTR("$f New $f Opportunity

As you know, the Emperor himself has arranged to visit the site of the disaster in the central event of a highly publicized tour.  Thousands of ships, representing every controlled sector, have been drawn up in order to form his escort and parade the Empire's strength.  Due to the scale of this event, several battle groups will be temporarily under strength.  Our aim is to stretch out one of these forces and bring down an Imperial Star Destroyer.", -1)

$Stage Text:
 XSTR("$f Excoriator (Page 1)

Of our potential targets, we have determined that the Excoriator is by far the most strategically vulnerable.  Perhaps equally importantly, this vessel's role in the bombardment of Thisspias will make her destruction a powerful political statement.  The objective of our next sequence of missions is to divide Excoriator from her support vessels, particularly Carrack cruiser group Manarai.  This group is presently stationed in the Tanaab system for the purpose of suppressing seasonal pirate activity.", -1)

$Stage Text:
 XSTR("$f Excoriator (Page 2)

Tanaab is an agricultural hub on the Perlemian trade route and is a frequent target for outlaw groups who prey on shipping.  Excoriator's presence has not stopped these pirate attacks but merely moved them into other nearby systems, forcing the Empire to take on escort duty for those convoys deemed essential to military operations.  The total number of vessels present in the sector has been substantially reduced for the occasion of the Emperor's rally, and the destroyer's fighter wing has been weakened by our disruption of their supply chains.", -1)

Though we possess substantial advantages over Excoriator, this task will not be easy.  Under ideal circumstances, a ship of this class would outgun our entire combined force.  Our intention is to make the circumstances of the engagement as far from ideal as possible.  

For security purposes, no personal transmissions will be permitted until these operations are concluded.  Captain Du'Elo?", -1)
