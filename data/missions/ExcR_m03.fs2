 XSTR("$f Red squadron will skim the rings of $h Koordan $h V, arriving at the mining site shortly before the convoy jumps in.  Red group was chosen because precision bombing won't be required, and they're our best dogfighters in case hostile snubs are present.  The miners are on the lookout for pirates, so they'll stop at the edge of the system to make a sensor sweep before jumping to the field.  Your ships will have to play dead during that sweep or they'll detect you and pull up short.  Once the convoy arrives, quickly disable escort $h Corvette $h Kinrath along with as many freighters as possible.
