Imperial Intelligence has been trying to identify a group of officers that are suspected of planning a coup against the Emperor.
The names of these traitors were unknown until new evidence, corroborated by reports from agent Merrock Tan, implicated Captain Lurik Arkeen and the bridge crew of the Star Destroyer Excoriator.", -1)

They intended to replace the enlisted men with a skeleton crew comprised of sub-human workers and revolutionaries.
Their blindness led them to believe they could trust members of the Rebel Alliance, who were planning on taking Excoriator for themselves.
The Rebels were unable to capture it, but the recent battle has left the destroyer crippled.", -1)

I regret that I am unable to deliver this message in person, but you must understand these precautions are necessary for the survival of our movement.  Commander Berent was a friend and a patriot, and his vote of confidence in you is not without weight, but spies are a constant danger.

We are a group of officers from all branches of the service who have concluded that the Emperor is no longer fit to oversee the New Order.  We are not Rebels, and we revere the Emperor as the greatest hero the galaxy has ever known, but he is an old man, and has fallen victim to the suggestions of extremist elements within our military.  With the fate of the galaxy at stake, we cannot allow these forces to go unopposed.

If you can prove your loyalty to us, we would be glad to have the services of a pilot of such character and ability, but I warn you that this will not be an easy or painless process.  If you wish to strike out on your own, we can provide safe transport to a world of your choosing.  Thank you for helping us in our most desperate hour.
